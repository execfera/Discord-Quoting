# Discord-Client-Modding
Modding the Windows Discord Client

Important: This should be deemed as a mod loader not competition for other discord clients. They on one side customize internal features, we on the other hand allow custom themes and non-nodejs code to be injected into the internal browser.  

#To install
- Win + R (Open run)
- "tskill Discord" + enter (fully shutdown discord) 
- Download the latest app.asar from http://itsghost.me/app.asar
- Go to C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Discord\ Discords Latest Version \resources
- Replace the app.asar with the one you freshly downloaded 
- Open Discord with administrator privileges
- Enjoy

#How to get started modding
Scripts (JavaScript files to be injected) should be placed in "C:\Discord\Scripts"

Themes (StyleSheat/CSS) should be placed in "C:\Discord\Styles"

#Contributing
Be sure to PR your own scripts and themes to keep this project ongoing!
